# Project 0

In this project, I decided to showcase one of my hobbies (journaling). I thought it would be interesting and relatively straightforward.

The index file is the "home" page of sorts, meant to act as an overview of everything.
The gallery file is just a gallery of different journal spreads I've done with a short description of each image.
The process file is the steps I take when I journal (usually).
The inspiration file is where I added a few videos from people that inspire me when it comes to journaling. The bootstrap component I used was the responsive embed component, and I also used the bootstrap grid system.
