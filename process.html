      <h1>My Journaling Process</h1>

        <div class="step1">
          Step 1: Determine the Theme
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Before I start making anything, I have to figure out the theme. I usually choose my theme based on current events, just like a diary. Some examples of themes would be
            the weather (maybe there was just a storm), any songs that recently came out, a tv show/movie, etc.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step2">
          Step 2: Gather supplies
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Once I have a theme decided, I can go through all my art supplies to pick what I need. These are the basics I usually pick from:
          </p>
        </div>

        <table class="table table-bordered">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Printed pictures</td>
              <td>Magazine clippings</td>
              <td>Memo sheets</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Washi tape</td>
              <td>Stickers</td>
              <td>Highlighters/markers</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Pens</td>
              <td>Sticky notes</td>
              <td>Scissors/hole punch</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <div class="step3">
          Step 3: Glue in Pictures & Clippings
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            After I have what I need, it's pretty straightforward. Depending on the theme, I may layer clippings and pictures differently.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step4">
          Step 4: Add Stickers & Washi Tape
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            When all the pictures are down, I basically have free reign to put as many stickers as I want, seeing as they're the topmost layer on the page. However, I usually lay down any washi tape I want first before
            stickers, and sometimes I even lay the tape down before any pictures.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step5">
          Step 5: Do the Writing + Cleanup
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The last step is to write in whatever I want. Sometimes it's a simple diary page, sometimes it's song lyrics or a poem - it depends. After that I trim off any
            excess tape and anything covering the holes in my journal pages (they're hole-punched to fit in a binder).
          </p>
          <p>
            After all of that, the journal spread is done! That's my general process for journaling, but it's of course adjustable.
